# knitcount2
A [stitch counting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_counter_%28hand_knitting%29) web app.

This is a rewrite of [knitcount](https://github.com/alliejones/knitcount/) built using some fancy new front-end tech:
* [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [Immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/)
* [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) architecture (courtesy of [Marty.js](https://github.com/jhollingworth/marty))
